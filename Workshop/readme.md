# SpeedUpR

---
Speeding up ecological and evolutionary computations in R; essentials of high performance computing for biologists.
---

Supporting files for the various workshops on code efficiency given at EvoDemos, BES and ESA. 

The workshops reviewed common challenges to computational efficiency for typical ecological problems, 
offer solutions on a sliding scale of time and coding investment but especially demonstrate how to determine
whether to invest in speeding up code.

The workshop is based on a recent published educational piece on high performance computing 
(Visser et al. 2015, PLOS Comp. Bio. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004140). 

This guthub repository contains the main exercise slides as latex-beamer-knitr presenations.
Therefore, all code shown in the .pdf files are embedded in the .Rnw files.
